# hamburger-menu-template
A hamburger menu is a popular navigation pattern used for mobile and responsive web design. It consists of a button with three horizontal lines (resembling a hamburger) that, when clicked, opens a hidden menu with links to other parts of the website. This allows users to access the site's content without having to navigate back to the homepage.
